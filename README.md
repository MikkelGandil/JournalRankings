# JournalRankings
In this notebook I scrape [eigenfactor.org](eigenfactor.org) for journal rankings and compute inequality statistics.  

The notebook is focused on economics but in the last section I compare economics to other social sciences.  

Code has not been checked for errors.

The csv-file contains the scraped data for the social science fields specified in the notebook
