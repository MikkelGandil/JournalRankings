# JournalRankings
In this notebook I scrape [eigenfactor.org](eigenfactor.org)  and [scimagojr.com](https://www.scimagojr.com/) for journal rankings and compute inequality statistics.  

The notebooks are focused on economics but in the last section of the eigenfactor-notebook I compare economics to other social sciences.  

Code has not been checked for errors.

The csv-file contains the scraped data for the social science fields specified in the eigen-factor notebook
